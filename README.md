## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Also I added: 
- Simple Validation on the username,email and phone number fields
- The chosen plan, billing type and addons are stored on localstorage 
- The form will be sent using ajax

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript (procedural programming)


### What I learned

It's My first time that I work with the Mobile first approach, First I started the project by designing the desktop version, then I faced some scenarios so I decided to change to Mobile first approach to solve them and the result was impressive. I liked the process and I will use It again in the next projects

### Continued development

- I will work on the accessibility (One of my inconvenients)
- I will implement this form with php to send the data through it
